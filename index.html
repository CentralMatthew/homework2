    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>William Bradley Pitt was born on December 18, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to William Alvin Pitt, the proprietor
        of a
        trucking company, and Jane Etta (n√©e Hillhouse), a school counselor. The family soon moved to Springfield,
        Missouri, where he lived together with his younger siblings, Douglas Mitchell (born 1966) and Julie Neal (born
        1969). Born into a conservative Christian household, he was raised as Southern Baptist and later
        "oscillate between agnosticism and atheism." He later reconciled his belief in spirituality. Pitt has
        described Springfield as "Mark Twain country, Jesse James country," having grown up with "a lot of hills, a lot
        of
        lakes."</p>
